                    <p>These past three months at HELP International School have been transformative. From my first day of uncertainty to my last day of confidence, every challenge, every bug fixed, every system deployed, and every person I met shaped me into a better developer and professional.</p>
                    
                    <p>This internship wasn't just about writing code—it was about building relationships, learning from mistakes, celebrating small victories, and understanding that technology serves people. Behind every line of code I wrote were real people: students waiting to register for exams, HR staff seeking better workflows, teachers planning parent meetings.</p>
                    
                    <p>I came here as a student eager to learn. I leave as someone who understands that software engineering is as much about empathy, communication, and collaboration as it is about technical skill.</p>
                    
                    <p class="signature">To everyone who made this journey meaningful—this is for you.</p>

                    <h2>To Mr. Sie Kee Lau</h2>
                    <p>Thank you for being more than just a supervisor‚Äîyou were a mentor, a guide, and someone who believed in my potential even when I doubted myself. Your patience when I struggled with IIS deployment, your encouragement when I faced complex database issues, and your trust in letting me make decisions shaped my confidence as a developer.</p>
                    
                    <p>You taught me that good code is important, but understanding the people who use that code is even more important. Every "have you thought about..." question pushed me to think deeper, every code review taught me to write cleaner, and every meeting showed me how to communicate technical concepts clearly.</p>

                    <h2>To My EdTech Colleagues</h2>
                    <p>Thank you for welcoming an intern into your team with open arms. The lunches we shared, the debugging sessions where we crowded around one screen, the celebrations when deployments succeeded‚Äîthese moments made me feel like I truly belonged.</p>
                    
                    <p>You showed me that great teams support each other, share knowledge freely, and celebrate everyone's victories. Watching you work taught me professionalism, collaboration, and the joy of building technology that makes a difference.</p>

                    <h2>To the A Level Interns I Mentored</h2>
                    <p>Thank you for giving me the opportunity to teach. Explaining Git commands to you, watching you debug your first errors, seeing your excitement when your code finally worked‚Äîthese experiences taught me as much as I taught you.</p>
                    
                    <p>You reminded me of where I started, and showed me how far I've come. Your questions made me a better developer because they forced me to truly understand concepts deeply enough to explain them simply.</p>

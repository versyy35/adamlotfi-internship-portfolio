                    <h2>To the Exam Unit Team</h2>
                    <p>Thank you for your patience, your detailed feedback, and your willingness to collaborate with an intern who was still learning the ropes. Every meeting we had, every requirement you explained, every bug you helped me identify made the Exam Registration System better.</p>
                    
                    <p>You taught me that building software isn't just about writing code‚Äîit's about truly understanding the workflows, the pain points, and the needs of the people who will use it every single day. Your real-world insights transformed my abstract ideas into practical solutions.</p>

                    <h2>Thank You For</h2>
                    <p><strong>Your patience during beta testing:</strong> When bugs appeared at the worst times, you didn't lose faith. Instead, you carefully documented issues, explained edge cases I hadn't considered, and worked with me to find solutions. That collaborative spirit made all the difference.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Your detailed requirements:</strong> The retake/non-retake functionality, the payment logic modifications, the archiving system‚Äîthese weren't just features on a list. You took time to explain why each one mattered, how it would improve your workflow, and what success would look like.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Your honesty and feedback:</strong> You never sugarcoated issues. When something didn't work, you told me directly. When something worked well, you celebrated it with me. That honest feedback loop helped me grow faster than any textbook ever could.</p>
